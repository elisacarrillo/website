Hello and welcome to my website!  My name is **Karle Flanagan** and I am a statistics instructor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  I have taught introductory to thousands of students at UIUC since Spring of 2014.  In addition to teaching, I've also done some advising and research here at UIUC.

I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics, with a minor in secondary education. After that, I taught mathematics at a small-town high school before taking a job as a statistician in the insurance industry. After earning a Masterâ€™s in Statistics at UIUC, I started teaching Stat 100 and am currently working on course development for other statistics and data science courses using Python. My research interests include online education, optimizing efficiency in office hours for large classes, and active learning methods for undergraduate statistics instruction.

I'm also working on my PhD in the Department of Education here at UIUC!  I'm an Illini through and through!
